    能源貧窮指涉無法近用現代能源或是不足以負擔其成本。在台灣，此一議題在積極推動能源轉型的背景下受到了廣泛關注。台灣淨零轉型的路徑高度依賴天然氣的使用，

  Energy poverty, characterized by a lack of access to modern energy services
  or the inability to afford adequate energy consumption, presents a pressing challenge
  that influences personal well-being and societal development. In Taiwan, this issue
  has gained significant attention amidst an ambitious energy transition strategy
  aimed at reducing coal consumption, phasing out nuclear power, and increasing reliance
  on renewable energy and natural gas. However, Taiwan's heavy dependence on imported
  energy resources, particularly natural gas, coupled with limited stockpiling capacity,
  exposes the country to supply disruptions and price fluctuations, exacerbating existing
  energy inequalities. Low-income and small-sized households in Taiwan often face
  higher per capita energy consumption due to inefficient appliances, which intensifies
  their energy burden under the progressive tariff system. Gender disparities further
  contribute to energy poverty, with female-headed households being particularly vulnerable.
  This research investigates the non-linear relationship between household size and
  energy poverty risk, employing an expenditure-based Low-Income High Cost (LIHC)
  approach. Using data from Taiwan’s 2021 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure
  (SFIE), the study utilizes a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to explore the
  impact of household head's gender and family composition on energy poverty. The
  findings aim to provide nuanced insights into the complexities of energy poverty
  in Taiwan, informing targeted interventions for vulnerable populations.
