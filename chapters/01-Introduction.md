# Introduction {#sec:introduction}


Energy poverty, described as the lack of access to modern energy services or the inability to afford adequate levels of energy consumption, is a critical issue affecting both personal development and societal well-being [@GonzálezEguino2015EnergyPA]. Addressing energy poverty aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all by 2030 [@Lin2020NationalET]. Affordable and accessible energy services have significant implications across various sectors, including health, education, and economic development [@Baum2022EnergyAA; @Akram2022CausalityBA].

In Taiwan, energy poverty has garnered increasing attention, calling for tailored approaches to tackle this multifaceted issue. The Taiwanese government is implementing an ambitious energy transition plan to mitigate the effects of climate change. This plan focuses on expanding renewable energy sources, increasing natural gas as a transitional fuel, reducing coal consumption, and phasing out nuclear power [@Chen2023PerspectivesOT; @ndc_2024]. While natural gas offers environmental advantages over coal—such as lower greenhouse gas emissions and fewer air pollutants [@Aramillo2007ComparativeLA]—Taiwan's increasing reliance on natural gas introduces new challenges.

Taiwan imports nearly all its energy resources, with 98% of natural gas being imported. This heavy dependence, coupled with limited stockpiling capacity of only 7 to 11 days, creates significant vulnerabilities. Geopolitical tensions, particularly the Ukraine-Russia conflict, have contributed to rising energy prices in the residential sector [@TRI2023]. As Taipower has been selling electricity at a loss, there is a growing need for energy price adjustments to ensure the sustainability of the supply system. This dependence makes Taiwan more susceptible to supply disruptions and price fluctuations, potentially exacerbating existing energy inequality issues.

From an energy consumption perspective, low-income and small-sized households in Taiwan may have higher per capita energy consumption [@Huang2015TheDO]. The progressive electricity tariff system adopted by Taipower can further amplify this burden, as low-income households often lack the financial means to replace energy-inefficient appliances, leading to higher expenditures for the same level of energy services [@Su2020ResidentialED]. Energy price shocks disproportionately affect households at different income levels, with low-income households being more vulnerable [@Tuttle2017TheEO].

Income disparities between male-headed and female-headed households remain significant in Taiwan. According to the 2021 Report on Family Income and Expenditure[@DGBAS2022], male-headed households have a higher average disposable income (1,185,000 NTD) compared to female-headed households (880,000 NTD). While per capita disposable income shows no significant difference when adjusting for household size, energy poverty calculations are traditionally based on a per-household basis. This suggests that female-headed households may be more vulnerable to energy poverty.

Previous studies in Taiwan have examined residential electricity consumption patterns and their determinants [@Huang2015TheDO; @Su2019ResidentialED; @Su2020ResidentialED]. For instance, Huang (2015) employed quantile regression to analyze how household characteristics affect energy usage, finding that household size influences electricity consumption across all quantiles. Su et al. (2020) extended this analysis by incorporating urbanization and energy poverty into residential electricity demand estimations, suggesting that smaller-sized households should take more responsibility in energy conservation efforts.

However, these studies primarily focus on energy consumption rather than energy poverty, which encompasses broader social justice issues. This research aims to demonstrate that the implications for energy poverty in Taiwan are more complex. Specifically, we propose that for energy poverty risk, not only is there disparity between male- and female-headed households, but there exists a non-linear relationship between household size and the risk of falling into energy poverty. While smaller households may have higher per capita energy usage due to limited economies of scale, larger households with more dependents or fewer income recipients may face greater financial strain in paying energy bills.

To effectively capture the affordability aspect of energy poverty in Taiwan, this study adopts an expenditure-based method using the Low-Income High Cost (LIHC) approach. This method identifies households that are low-income but face disproportionate energy burdens. Utilizing data from the 2021 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE), which includes comprehensive information on household composition, attributes, facilities, housing conditions, income, and expenditure [@DGBAS2022], we employ a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to analyze the effects of household head's gender and family composition on the risk of falling into energy poverty.

Our research contributes to the existing literature by shifting the focus from analyzing energy consumption patterns to examining the complex factors influencing energy poverty in Taiwan. By considering both household head gender and family structure, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of energy poverty, informing policymakers to develop targeted interventions that address the specific needs of vulnerable populations. In Taiwan, although energy prices have been kept at a low and affordable range, leading many to perceive it as an insignificant issue. However, the disparity still exist, with certain households being more vulnerable to Net-Zero transition. Common policy interventions to address climate change often involve raising energy prices to incentivize reduced electricity consumption. However, such measures can disproportionately affect these vulnerable households. Therefore, tailored approaches are necessary to ensure that climate policies are both effective and equitable.

The remainder of this article will be divided into five parts. [Section 2](#sec:literaturereview) provides a general literature review of energy poverty landscape around the world and hypotheses of this article. [Section 3](#sec:methodology) illustrates the research method and design. [Section 4](#sec:results) will be presenting the empirical findings. The [final section](#sec:conclusion) discusses the  contributions and implications of this study.
